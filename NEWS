# `plotGMM` v 0.2.0
## Tools for Visualizing Gaussian Mixture Models

### Changes

* Added a new primary function, `plot_GMM`: The main function of the packcage, `plot_GMM` allows the user to simply input the name of a `mixEM` object (from fitting a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) via the `normalmixEM` function from the `mixtools` package), as well as the number of components, `k`, that were used in the original GMM fit. The result is a clean `ggplot2` object showing the density of the data with overlaid mixture weight component curves.  

## How do I get `plotGMM `?

The package is released on CRAN. If you have any questions or find any bugs requiring fixing, please feel free to contact us either directly (see the `DESCRIPTION` file for more) or by opening an issue ticket on GitHub. Thanks and enjoy!
